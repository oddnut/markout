<p>by LESLIE JENSEN-INMAN</p>
<p>Web education is out of date and fragmented. There are good people working hard to change this, but because of the structure of higher education, it will take time. As part of a year-long journey to discover where we are in web education and where we need to go, Leslie Jensen-Inman interviewed 32 web design and development leaders. The consensus: technology moves too fast for college and university curricula to keep up. How, then, can educators create a sustainable foundation for the future?</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/brighterhorizonsforwebeducation">Brighter Horizons for Web Education</a></h3>
<p>by AARRON WALTER</p>
<p>No industry can sustain itself if it doesn’t master the art of cultivating new talent—an art that requires close ties between practitioners and educators. Yet web design education consists mainly of introductory Flash classes and the occasional 90s-style HTML table layout tutorial. How drastic is the web design education gap, and what can be done to close it? Designer, developer, and web design educator Aarron Walter of The Web Standards Project surveys the state of the curricula.</p>

<h2>MFA Interaction Design deadline</h2>
<div class="endpost">
	<p>Today, January 15, marks the first application deadline for students to apply to the <a href="http://interactiondesign.sva.edu/">MFA Interaction Design program at School of Visual Arts</a>. The school will continue to accept applications on a rolling admissions basis as space allows, but don&#8217;t count on spaces staying open long—the program is limited to fifteen students. An <a href="http://interactiondesign.sva.edu/blog/entry/suggested_application_deadline_and_rolling_admissions/">application timeline</a> shows what students can expect between today and April.</p>
<p>In a city that also boasts Parsons, Pratt, and Cooper Union, New York&#8217;s School of Visual Arts holds a unique place. There are no full-time professors; instead, faculty are drawn from the ranks of New York&#8217;s top full-time practitioners. They are working designers, art directors, painters, sculptors, and so on. <a href="http://www.devitoverdi.com/">Sal Devito</a>, a creative director for whom I was privileged to work in the 1990s, is a legendary SVA instructor; so is <a href="http://www.miltonglaser.com/">Milton Glaser</a>. </p>
<p>As you would expect, the <a href="http://interactiondesign.sva.edu/faculty">faculty</a> of the MFA Interaction Design program includes some of the brightest people in user experience. (By some fluke, I am also a faculty member.) <a href="http://interactiondesign.sva.edu/faculty/profile/liz_danzico/">Liz Danzico</a>, former experience director of Happy Cog Studios, chairs the program.</p>
<p><!--</p>
<p>Bit of nostalgia: I moved to New York in 1988 so a (now ex-) girlfriend could attend SVA's computer design program; a later girlfriend was in its MFA painting program. Both were brilliant, intense, and fervently devoted to their art. That's the kind of student SVA's creative hothouse atmosphere attracts.</p>
<p>--></p>
<p>A good education is hard to find. When it comes to web and interaction design, it&#8217;s almost impossible.  I&#8217;m honored to be one of the faculty in the School of Visual Art&#8217;s MFA Interaction Design program, and look forward to teaching and learning there.</p>

	<h3><a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2009/01/12/jeffrey-zeldmans-web-standards-advisor/">12 January 2009</a> 10 am eastern</h3>
</div>

<h2>Jeffrey Zeldman&#8217;s Web Standards Advisor</h2>
<div class="endpost">
	<p>Launched today (my birthday), <a href="http://www.webassist.com/professional/products/productdetails.asp?PID=255&amp;WAAID=889">Jeffrey Zeldman&#8217;s Web Standards Advisor</a> is a $49.99 extension for Adobe Dreamweaver. It includes two major interfaces:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Web Validator validates your HTML and CSS and verifies the proper use of microformats, including <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCard</a> and <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar">hCalendar</a>, for single pages or entire websites. </li>
<li>The Web Standards Advisor checks for subtleties of standards compliance in nine different areas—everything from structural use of headings to proper <code>ID</code>, class, and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element use. Nonstandard practices are flagged and reported in the Dreamweaver Results panel for quick code correction. A full report with more details and suggested fixes is also generated.</li>
</ol>
<h3>How did it get here?</h3>
<p>Over coffee in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/aeanola08/pool/">New Orleans</a> last year, WebAssist&#8217;s Joseph Lowery and I chatted about a fantasy product that could improve the markup of even the most experienced front-end coder. The benefits were obvious. After all, better markup means lighter, faster web pages whose content is easier for search engines (and thus people) to find.</p>
<p>The product would look over your shoulder and notice things. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you were using a class when you might be better off using an <code>ID</code> (and vice-versa), the fantasy product would cough gently and tell you.</li>
<li>If you skipped a heading level—say, if you had h4s and h6s but no h5 on your site—it would discreetly whisper in your ear.</li>
<li>If, on an old site (or sadly, on a new one) you used class names that were visual instead of semantic (i.e. class=&#8221;big_yellow_box&#8221; instead of class=&#8221;additional_info&#8221;), it would quietly let you know about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, this was a fantasy product, because so many of these things seem to require human judgement. I didn&#8217;t think programmers could develop algorithms capable of simulating that level of judgement. Joseph Lowery took my doubt as a challenge.</p>
<p>A year of collaborative back-and-forth later, Jeffrey Zeldman&#8217;s Web Standards Advisor is a  working 1.0 product.</p>
<h3>How good is it?</h3>
<p>I ran Jeffrey Zeldman&#8217;s Web Standards Advisor on the four-year-old markup of this site&#8217;s current blog layout, and discovered embarrassing mistakes that don&#8217;t show up on validators. (I haven&#8217;t fixed those mistakes yet, by the way. For fun, or extra credit, see if you can figure out what they are.)</p>
<p>Then I ran the product on several new sites coded by some of the best CSS and markup people in the business, and found a surprising quantity of mistakes there, as well. Nobody&#8217;s perfect—not even the best coders.</p>
<p>Some of the errors the product found were mere errors of style, but were still worth correcting, if only to set a good example for those who view source on your sites. Other errors the product revealed could affect how easy it is for people to find a site&#8217;s content. Fixing such errors is a business necessity. </p>
<p>Some issues are purely judgement calls: is it okay to sometimes use <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>? When is it perfectly fine to skip a heading level? To address those subtleties, there is a <a href="http://webstandardsdesign.pbwiki.com/">wiki</a> where such topics are discussed, and &#8220;error&#8221; messages link to the relevant topics in the wiki, so you can click straight through to the online discussion.</p>
<h3>Who is it for?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jeffrey Zeldman&#8217;s Web Standards Advisor will help beginning and intermediate coders write smarter, more compliant markup that makes site content easier to find.</li>
<li>It will help coders at any level (including expert) who use Dreamweaver as a primary web development tool, and who know about web standards but don&#8217;t spend all day thinking about them. Now you don&#8217;t have to—and you can still create leaner sites that work for more people, and whose content is easier to find.</li>
<li>Site owners might run the product on their site, to see how compliant it is and how findable their markup allows their content to be.</li>
</ul>
<p>But what about many people reading this website, who write their XHTML and CSS by hand, and who rightfully consider themselves standardistas? That&#8217;s right. What about <em>you?</em></p>
<p>You aren&#8217;t the primary customer, but you might find the product useful. I&#8217;m a hand-coder and always will be. I own Dreamweaver mainly because it comes with Adobe CS3 and CS4. Installing Jeffrey Zeldman&#8217;s Web Standards Advisor is a no-brainer, and running it on my work (or that of people working for me) turns up enough surprises to more than justify the time and expense. </p>
<p>Plus, after you use it to clean up your own, small, embarrassing errors of markup, you can run it on your heroes&#8217; websites and revel in their mere mortality.</p>
<h3>Disclosing the obvious</h3>
<div class="floattenr" style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: 2px;"><a href="http://www.webassist.com/professional/products/productdetails.asp?PID=255&amp;WAAID=889" title="Jeffrey Zeldman's Web Standards Advisor"><img src="/i/zeldman_120x90.jpg" alt="Jeffrey Zeldman's Web Standards Advisor" /></a></div>
<p><a href="http://www.webassist.com/professional/products/productdetails.asp?PID=255&amp;WAAID=889">Jeffrey Zeldman&#8217;s Web Standards Advisor</a> is a product. It is not a free product. At $49.99, it&#8217;s not terribly expensive, but it&#8217;s not free. </p>
<p>I have a small financial interest and a gigantic brand interest in it. If it&#8217;s a weak product, it reflects badly on me, my agency, my conference, my books, and possibly even the very category of web standards. I therefore have a huge stake in making sure it&#8217;s a good product—that it&#8217;s easy to use, meets real needs now, and evolves in response to customer feedback and the slow but steady evolution of standards. (XHTML 2? HTML 5? More microformats? Stay tuned.)</p>

<h2>Jason Has Left the Building</h2>
<div class="endpost">
	<p>I owe it all to <a href="http://www.dbowman.com/">Douglas Bowman</a>&#8217;s bad back.</p>
<p>Doug and <a href="http://www.brianalvey.com/">Brian Alvey</a> and <a href="http://speedbird.wordpress.com/">Adam Greenfield</a> and I were working on a big client project when Doug&#8217;s back went out. He was so sick, he couldn&#8217;t work, and it was unclear when he would be able to work again.</p>
<p>As a friend, I was worried about Doug. As a creative director, I was worried about finishing my client&#8217;s project. </p>
<p>Doug and I had both done designs. The client liked my design but I&#8217;d sold him Doug&#8217;s. Now Doug couldn&#8217;t finish, and I didn&#8217;t trust myself to execute the remaining pages in Doug&#8217;s style. I needed someone skilled enough to finish what Doug had started and mature enough to sublimate his own style while still making good design choices.</p>
<p>I had just read &#8220;<a href="http://v3.jasonsantamaria.com/archive//2004/05/24/grey_box_method.php">Grey Box Methodology</a>,&#8221; a well-written romp through a personal design process. The author was a young designer named Jason Santa Maria. His site looked great, his portfolio was impressive, he had good ideas about design, and the process he had written about lent itself to the technical aspects of finishing Doug&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>I wrote to Jason Santa Maria, telling him I had a small freelance project that was probably boring  and would bring him no glory, since it required him to design like someone else. Jason was game and said yes. He did a great job and was egoless about it, and he seemed perfectly comfortable working with better established, heavyweight talents. His quick, professional, selfless work kept the project going until Doug was back on his feet.</p>
<p>To reward Jason for what he had done, when a new and juicy assignment came my way, I asked if he wanted to be the project&#8217;s lead designer. The rest you can you figure out.</p>
<p>For four and a half years, Jason Santa Maria has been a designer and then a creative director at <a href="http://www.happycog.com/">Happy Cog</a>. In an agency filled with talent, he made a huge personal mark. I&#8217;ve trusted him with some of the most important designs we&#8217;ve handled, from <a href="http://www.aiga.org/">AIGA</a> to the redesign of <cite><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a></cite>. He has never let me down, professionally or personally. More than that, his work has expanded my conception of <a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/articles/">what web design can be</a>.</p>
<p>Four and a half years is a couple of centuries in internet time. For about a year, Jason and I have known that it was getting to be time for him to move on. Not that we had any problem with him or he with us. But just that nearly half a decade is a long time for any designer to spend in one place.</p>
<p>As he has <a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/articles/leaving-happy-cog/">just announced</a>, Jason is leaving Happy Cog. He will stay involved in <cite>A List Apart</cite> and perhaps a few selected projects, but basically he is out the door and spreading his wings. Godspeed.</p>

<h2>ALA 275: Duty Now For The Future</h2>
<div class="endpost">
	<p>What better way to begin 2009 than by looking at the future of web design? In <a href="http://alistapart.com/issues/275">Issue No. 275</a> of <cite>A List Apart,</cite> for people who make websites, we study the promise and problems of HTML 5, and chart a path toward mobile CSS that works.</p>
<h3><a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/returnofthemobilestylesheet">Return of the Mobile Style Sheet</a></h3>
<p>by DOMINIQUE HAZAËL-MASSIEUX</p>
<p>At least 10% of your visitors access your site over a mobile device. They deserve a good experience (and if you provide one, they’ll keep coming back). Converting your multi-column layout to a single, linear flow is a good start. But mobile devices are not created equal, and their disparate handling of CSS is like 1998 all over again. Please your users and tame their devices with handheld style sheets, CSS media queries, and (where necessary) JavaScript or server-side techniques.</p>
<h3><a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/semanticsinhtml5">Semantics in HTML 5</a></h3>
<p>by JOHN ALLSOPP</p>
<p>The BBC’s dropping of hCalendar because of accessibility and usability concerns demonstrates that we have pushed the semantic capability of HTML far beyond what it can handle. The need to clearly and unambiguously add rich, meaningful semantics to markup is a driving goal of the HTML 5 project. Yet HTML 5 has two problems: it is not backward compatible because its semantic elements will not work in 75% of our browsers; and it is not forward compatible because its semantics are not extensible. If “making up new elements” isn’t the solution, what is?</p>

	<h3><a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2009/01/01/an-event-apart-redesigned/">1 January 2009</a> 11 am eastern</h3>
</div>

<h2>An Event Apart redesigned</h2>
<div class="endpost">
	<p>There&#8217;s a new <a href="http://www.aneventapart.com/">aneventapart.com</a> in town, featuring a <a href="http://www.aneventapart.com/events/">2009 schedule</a> and a reformulated design. I designed the new site and Eric Meyer coded. (Validation freaks, only <a href="http://validator.nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aneventapart.com%2F">validator.nu is up to the task</a> of recognizing the HTML 5 DOCTYPE used and validating against it; the validator.w3.org and htmlhelp.com validators can&#8217;t do this yet. Eric chose HTML 5 because it permits any element to be an HREF, and this empowered him to solve complex layout problems with simple, semantic markup. Eric, I know, will have loads more to say about this.)</p>
<p>Family branding concerns drove the previous design. Quite simply, the original An Event Apart site launched simultaneously with the 2005 redesign of <cite><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a></cite>. <a href="http://www.jasonsantamaria.com/">Jason Santa Maria</a>&#8217;s stripped-down visual rethink was perfect for the magazine and is imitated, written about, and stolen outright to this day. It was a great design for our web magazine because it was created in response to the magazine&#8217;s content. It didn&#8217;t work as well for the conference because its design wasn&#8217;t driven by the kind of content a conference site publishes. But it was the right conference design for 2005 because the goal at that time was to create a strong brand uniting the long-running web design magazine with the new web design conference that sprang from it.</p>
<h3>New goals for a new environment</h3>
<p>In 2009, it&#8217;s less important to bolt the conference to the magazine by using the same layout for both: by now, most people who attend or have thought about attending An Event Apart know it is the A List Apart web design conference. What&#8217;s important in 2009 is to provide plenty of information about the show, since decisions about conference-going are being made in a financially (and psychologically) constricted environment. In 2005, it was enough to say &#8220;A List Apart has a conference.&#8221; Today more is needed. Today you need plenty of content to explain to the person who controls the purse strings just what you will learn and why a different conference wouldn&#8217;t be the same or &#8220;just as good.&#8221; </p>
<p>The redesign therefore began with a <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/issues/274">content strategy</a>. The new design and new architecture fell out of that.</p>
<h3>Action photos and high contrast</h3>
<p>The other thing I went for—again, in conscious opposition to the beautifully understated previous design—was <em>impact</em>. I wanted this design to feel big and spacious (even on an iPhone&#8217;s screen) and to wow you with, for lack of a better word, a sense of <em>eventfulness</em>. And I think the big beautiful location images and the unafraid use of high contrast help achieve that. </p>
<p>Reinforcing the high contrast and helping to paint an event-focused picture, wherever possible I used action shots of our amazing speakers holding forth from the stage, rather than the more typical friendly backyard amateur head shot used on every other conference site (including the previous version of ours). I wanted to create excitement about the presentations these brilliant people will be making, and live action stage photos seemed like the way to do that. After all, if I&#8217;m going to see Elvis Costello perform, I want to see a picture of him onstage with his guitar—not a friendly down-to-earth shot of him taking out the garbage or hugging his nephews. </p>
<p>So that&#8217;s a quick overview of the redesign. The store is now open for all four shows and the <a href="http://www.aneventapart.com/2009/seattle/">complete Seattle show schedule</a> is available for your viewing pleasure. I hope to see some of you in 2009 at our <a href="http://www.aneventapart.com/about/">intensely educational two-day conference</a> for people who make websites. </p>

</div>

<h2>Time Warner Cable canceling Noggin?</h2>
<div class="endpost">
	<p>I have a full day&#8217;s work to do, but I&#8217;m home watching my four-year-old. Thus, this morning, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noggin_(TV_channel)">Noggin</a> was on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy, what&#8217;s that black?&#8221; my daughter asked, pointing to the TV.</p>
<p>A black crawl eating 20% of the screen announced that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner_Cable">Time Warner Cable</a>, New York City&#8217;s virtual monopoly cable provider, will stop broadcasting Noggin at midnight tonight. </p>
<p>Comedy Central (home of Jon Stewart&#8217;s The Daily Show), MTV, and other Viacom-owned channels will also be lost, the crawl said. But as the parent of a child under five, you&#8217;re asleep before The Daily Show comes on, and you haven&#8217;t cared about MTV since Run DMC walked this way with Aerosmith. </p>
<p>Time Warner Cable can do what it likes where your personal entertainment needs are concerned. But if they stop broadcasting Noggin, your four-year-old won&#8217;t shrug it off. It will be like when great grandma died. </p>
<p>Your mission is clear. You have to save Noggin.</p>
<p>The crawl and the websites of the soon-to-be-cancelled channels list a toll-free 800 number where customers can demand that Time Warner Cable keep Noggin on.</p>
<p>When you call the number, Time Warner announces that it cannot take your call due to &#8220;technical difficulties&#8221; and hangs up on you.</p>
<p>In its way, it&#8217;s kind of brilliant. By not answering their customer feedback number, Time Warner can claim not to have heard from their customers.</p>
<p>Although I subscribe to their overpriced service, I&#8217;m no fan. Since I described my frustrations with their  <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2008/10/28/fast-high-speed-access-for-nyc-internet-professionals/">fast, high-speed access</a>, Time Warner Cable&#8217;s RoadRunner Turbo has continued to pile on the incompetence. This month they sent me a new modem and told me I needed to manually replace my old one. Beside the fact that nothing&#8217;s wrong with my old one, the new one isn&#8217;t compatible with my set-up, which is wireless. </p>
<p>Time Warner set up the wireless network using their wireless modem, and charges a monthly surcharge for the wireless activity they provide. But they sent me a non-wireless modem as a replacement. A two-man shop in Kazakhstan&#8217;s smallest town would not send a non-wireless modem to replace a wireless one. But Time Warner Cable does, because they are a monopoly and under no pressure to offer competent service. </p>
<p>And yet, although Time Warner Cable&#8217;s uncountable levels of existential suckage could induce vomiting in a giraffe, reality is never as clear-cut as a crawl on Noggin.</p>
<p>It is obvious that Time Warner Cable and Viacom are playing hardball in a price negotiation. Time Warner wants the Viacom channels cheaper than Viacom wants to sell them. Instead of working out a deal like mensches, the companies are taking their impasse to the public, and playing on the anxieties of parents with young children. Indeed, Viacom appears the guiltier company, since it is Viacom that is running crawls on its channels and popups on its websites, using the kind of language and typography more properly reserved for fake terror threat alerts.</p>
<p>Although Time Warner doesn&#8217;t answer its customer feedback number, some of the company&#8217;s phone numbers still work, and if you loop your way through a sufficient number of audio menus, you soon hear the company&#8217;s claim to be negotiating with Viacom. </p>
<p>If it were only about me, both companies could stuff it. </p>
<p>Will no one think of the children?</p>

<h2>Understanding web design, live on video</h2>
<div class="endpost">
	<p>Now available on streaming video, <a href="http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/video-gain-2008-zeldman">Jeffrey Zeldman: Understanding Web Design</a> &#8212; is a good quality 42:40 capture of my October 25, 2008 presentation at Gain: AIGA Business and Design Conference. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Author and Happy Cog founder Jeffrey Zeldman answers the question: what does a web designer need most? Skills and knowledge of software, of course, but empathy—the ability to think about and empathize with your user—is by far the most important. Good useful education is hard to find, and within companies there is often no departmental standardization. Good graphic design is not the same as good user experience design, he explains. In fact, “good web design is invisible”—it feels simple and authentic because it’s about the character of the content, not the character of the designer.</p>
